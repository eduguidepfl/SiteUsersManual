# Requesting an IT Test

IT Testing helps to ensure that your school's network is prepared for your students to begin using EduGuide’s site and the path system. Admin coaches will be prompted to send a request for IT testing during the initial setup for the team, but can always return to the page whenever they need to send the request. After the request goes out, you will be able to monitor your technical support person’s progress from the IT Test page. A checkmark will appear when they mark the test as passed, and an "x" will display if they mark the test as having failed.

## Sending the IT Test Request

From the IT Testing page, enter in the email address for your technical contact into the field provided and then click "Save Changes & Continue." Your changes will be saved, and an invitation will be sent. The email instructs the tech person to navigate to the EduGuide site and join a team where they will be lead through a wizard and then a simplified version of the path. They will be asked to complete tasks such as adding EduGuide's domain to their list of approved URLs, and responding to different types of steps inside the path.

Along the way, they are invited to share notes about any issues they noticed during the testing, and can indicate at the end whether the testing passed or failed.
