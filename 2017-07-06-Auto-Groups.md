# Auto Groups

As coaches go through the Team Settings page during the process of launching their team they will be prompted to make a choice about activating the site's auto groups setting.

Autogroups is a function which automatically creates a new group for each support and lead coach that is invited to join the team. While the invitations are pending, the groups will contain the invited coach's email address. When the coach responds to their invitation, they will be automatically assigned as a follower of the group and the groupâ€™s title will be changed so that it contains their name.

You can change your team's autogroups setting later after your team has launched by returning to the team settings page, or making the adjustment in the groups management page.
