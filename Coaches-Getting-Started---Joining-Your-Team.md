Joining Your Team

Once EduGuide receives a PO and a contract from your organization, you will be sent an invitation asking you to launch your team and invite your colleagues as coaches. When you click on the "Launch Team" button in the email, you will be taken to the EduGuide website

## Logging into your Account

The first page you will see asks you if you already have an account or if you need to create a new one. Typically, new coaches will not already have an account, so registration is required. But, if you happened to have been on the Demo Team, or on another EduGuide team prior to purchasing the platform for your organization, you can log into your existing account and save some time.

Clicking "Yes, Login" will take you to the log in screen for EduGuide. Note that the join code for your team will already be included in the field towards the bottom. This code will match you with your new partner team. When you've entered in your account credentials, click “Login.”

## Creating a New Account

If you do not have an account on EduGuide's site yet, you would click on "No, Join." You will be taken to the registration form for a new account.

Your email address and the name of your team will be automatically displayed in the account registration form. Complete the other fields, and then click "Join." Your account will be created, and you will be added to your team as an Admin Coach. The next screen will ask you if you will be administering the team yourself, or if you would like to delegate this responsibility to somebody else.

# Setting up Your Team

## Selecting an Administrator

Sometimes, the person who selected EduGuide's platform, handled the billing, or will be directing their staff inside the team is not the same person who has the information that’s necessary in order to set up the team. This screen allows you to delegate the task of setting up the team to a different person who will be spending more time on the team. Click "Someone Else" if you would like to involve someone else. Otherwise, click “I’m Administering.”

When you click on "Someone Else," you will be taken to a confirmation screen.

And prompted to enter in the email address for the person who you would like to ask to complete the team set up process:

They will get an invitation to set up the team.

## Configuring the team

The process of setting up your team starts as soon as you join. Other admin coaches will also be taken into into the team settings until all of the tasks are complete. Once the team's settings have been entered, coaches are taken to the metrics page after they log on. The Settings page can be accessed later from the main navigation menu.

### Inviting Coaches and Captains

#### Coach Roles

See [Role Help Pages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs93xeQ-b3oNDFlxW-eafAOyhXThyTeRH3MTn0fxYs0/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Inviting Coaches

As you go complete the list of setup tasks to complete for your team, you will be prompted to send invitations to the colleagues who you would like to serve as coaches. After the steup process is complete, you will be able to return to this same page and section by clicking on 'Setup" under the main navigation.

Within the Coach invite section, you can send an invitation to a colleague by entering in their email address, then selecting their coaching role. You can choose from Captain, Admin, Lead, and Support. Coaches who serve as a captain carry the dual role of captain and admin coach.

Once you have entered all of the email addresses in, click on "Save Changes & Continue."

Next, a modal will appear where you can enter in an optional custom message and a student start date. The Student start date will be shown in the team coach invitation.

After you send the coach invites, emails will be sent to each person prompting them to register on the site and join the team.

#### Inviting Captains

As you are inviting a colleague to serve as a team captain, you will first enter their email address into the field under "User," and then click on “Save Changes & Continue.” A prompt will appear asking for an optional custom message and a student start date.
